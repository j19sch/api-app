# Extras

## Next steps

The `next_steps` directory contains several options for extending your test framework:
- `debugging.md`: explains how to use the Python debugger with pytest
- `test_jsonschema.py`: validate the response with the jsonschema libary
- `test_log_to_file.py`: write your test logs to a file
- `test_parametrization.py`: uses pytest's parametrization to run the same test with different inputs
- `test_schema_validation.py`: validate the response with the schema library
- `test_setup_teardown_fixture.py`: uses a fixture to set up date, `yield`s it to the test, removes it in teardown
- `test_teardown_only_fixture.py`: uses a fixture to remove a piece of data created in the test
- `test_with_testdata_from_file.py`: read data from a file to use in a test

If you want even more options for logging, have a look at a pytest plugin I built: pytest-instrument at
https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instrument/.


## Same test, different tools
The `same_test_different_tools` directory contains the same test (deleting a book) implemented
using different tools:
- behave: run with `behave <path>`, i.e. `behave extras/same_test_different_tools/behave/features/`
- pytest and requests: run with `pytest <path>`, i.e. `pytest extras/same_test_different_tools/pytest/`
- robot framework with robotframework-requests:  run with `robot <path>`, i.e. `robot extras/same_test_different_tools/robot-framework/`
- tavern:  run with  `pytest <path>`, i.e. `pytest extras/same_test_different_tools/tavern`
